I'm Florian, a CS student is interested mainly in Rust and WebAssembly but also low-level computer graphics.

During the day, I'm currently studying for my Master's degree at [TU BS](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/), while also working on a [safety-critical WebAssembly interpreter](https://github.com/dlr-ft/wasm-interpreter).
At night, I enjoy developing [WebAssembly plugin systems,](https://github.com/florianhartung/wasm-for-plugin-systems) my custom text editor (not open sourced yet), my [voxel renderer](https://github.com/florianhartung/voxel-rs) or path tracers.
